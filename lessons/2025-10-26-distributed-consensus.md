# Day 19: Agreement in Distributed Systems

## Overview
Distributed consensus algorithms enable multiple nodes to agree on a single value or state despite failures and network issues.

## Key Concepts
- **Raft Algorithm**
- **Paxos**
- **Leader Election**
- **Log Replication**

## System Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    Leader[Leader Node] --> Follower1[Follower 1]
    Leader --> Follower2[Follower 2]
    Leader --> Follower3[Follower 3]
    Client --> Leader
    Leader --> Log[Replicated Log]
    Follower1 --> Log1[Local Log]
    Follower2 --> Log2[Local Log]
```

## Real-World Example
etcd uses Raft consensus to maintain consistent configuration data for Kubernetes clusters across multiple servers

## Discussion Questions
1. How does the Raft algorithm handle network partitions?
2. When would you choose Paxos over Raft for consensus?
