# Day 11: Protecting Systems from Overload

## Overview
Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to prevent system overload and ensure fair resource usage.

## Key Concepts
- **Token Bucket**
- **Leaky Bucket**
- **Fixed Window**
- **Sliding Window**

## System Diagram

    Request --> RateLimit{Rate Limiter}
    RateLimit -->|Allowed| Process[Process Request]
    RateLimit -->|Denied| Error[Return 429 Error]
    Process --> Response[Send Response]
```

## Real-World Example
Twitter's API rate limiting prevents abuse while allowing legitimate developers to build applications on their platform

## Discussion Questions
1. How would you implement distributed rate limiting across multiple servers?
2. What factors determine appropriate rate limits for different API endpoints?
