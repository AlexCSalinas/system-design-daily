# Day 12: Observability in Distributed Systems

## Overview
Comprehensive monitoring and logging provide visibility into system health, performance, and behavior for troubleshooting and optimization.

## Key Concepts
- **Metrics**
- **Logs**
- **Traces**
- **Alerting**
- **Dashboards**

    Logs --> Search[Log Search]
    Traces --> Analysis[Performance Analysis]
```

## Real-World Example
Google's SRE practices use SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets to maintain 99.99% uptime across their services

## Discussion Questions
1. How do you balance detailed logging with system performance?
2. What metrics are most important for measuring system health?
