# Day 18: Asynchronous Event Processing

## Overview
Event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between loosely coupled services, enabling reactive and scalable systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Event Sourcing**
- **CQRS**
- **Event Streaming**
- **Saga Pattern**

## System Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    Producer[Event Producer] --> Stream[Event Stream]
    Stream --> Consumer1[Consumer 1]
    Stream --> Consumer2[Consumer 2]
    Stream --> Consumer3[Consumer 3]
    Consumer1 --> Action1[Action A]
    Consumer2 --> Action2[Action B]
```

## Real-World Example
LinkedIn's Kafka-based event streaming platform processes over 7 trillion messages per day for real-time analytics and recommendations

## Discussion Questions
1. How do you handle event ordering in a distributed event-driven system?
2. What are the challenges of implementing saga patterns for distributed transactions?
