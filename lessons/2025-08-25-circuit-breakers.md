# Day 17: Preventing Cascading Failures

## Overview
Circuit breakers protect systems from cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to failing services and allowing them to recover.

## Key Concepts
- **Closed State**
- **Open State**
- **Half-Open State**
- **Failure Threshold**

## System Diagram

    Request --> CB{Circuit Breaker}
    CB -->|Closed| Service[Call Service]
    CB -->|Open| Fallback[Return Fallback]
    CB -->|Half-Open| Test[Test Service]
    Service --> Success[Success]
    Service --> Failure[Failure]
    Failure --> Open[Open Circuit]
```

## Real-World Example
Netflix's Hystrix library implements circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures across their microservices architecture

## Discussion Questions
1. How do you determine appropriate failure thresholds for circuit breakers?
2. What fallback strategies work best for different types of services?
