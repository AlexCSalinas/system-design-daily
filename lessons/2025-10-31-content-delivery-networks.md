# Day 4: CDN Architecture and Edge Computing

## Overview
CDNs distribute content across geographically dispersed servers to reduce latency and improve user experience globally.

## Key Concepts
- **Edge Servers**
- **Origin Server**
- **Cache Hit Ratio**
- **Geographic Distribution**

## System Diagram

    User1[User US] --> Edge1[US Edge Server]
    User2[User EU] --> Edge2[EU Edge Server]
    Edge1 --> Origin[Origin Server]
    Edge2 --> Origin
```

## Real-World Example
Cloudflare operates 250+ data centers globally to serve static content with minimal latency

## Discussion Questions
1. How would you handle dynamic content with a CDN?
2. What strategies would you use to optimize cache hit ratios?
