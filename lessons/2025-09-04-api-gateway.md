# Day 7: Centralized API Management

## Overview
API gateways provide a single entry point for client requests, handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and routing.

## Key Concepts
- **Request Routing**
- **Authentication**
- **Rate Limiting**
- **Request/Response Transformation**

## System Diagram

    Client --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Auth{Authentication}
    Auth --> Rate{Rate Limiting}
    Rate --> Route{Request Routing}
    Route --> Service1[Service A]
    Route --> Service2[Service B]
```

## Real-World Example
Netflix's Zuul gateway handles billions of requests daily, providing resilience and monitoring for their microservices

## Discussion Questions
1. How would you implement versioning through an API gateway?
2. What are the trade-offs of using an API gateway vs direct service communication?
