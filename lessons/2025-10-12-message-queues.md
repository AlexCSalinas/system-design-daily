# Day 5: Asynchronous Communication Patterns

## Overview
Message queues enable asynchronous communication between services, improving system resilience and scalability.

## Key Concepts
- **Producer-Consumer**
- **Pub-Sub**
- **Dead Letter Queues**
- **Message Ordering**

## System Diagram
```mermaid
graph LR
    Producer --> Queue[Message Queue]
    Queue --> Consumer1[Consumer 1]
    Queue --> Consumer2[Consumer 2]
    Queue --> Consumer3[Consumer 3]
```

## Real-World Example
Uber uses Apache Kafka to handle real-time location updates and trip matching across their platform

## Discussion Questions
1. How would you ensure message ordering in a distributed queue system?
2. When would you choose RabbitMQ over Apache Kafka?
