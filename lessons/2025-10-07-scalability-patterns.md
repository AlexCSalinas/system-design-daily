# Day 20: Designing for Growth and Scale

## Overview
Scalability patterns provide proven approaches to handle increasing load through horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, and architectural improvements.

## Key Concepts
- **Horizontal Scaling**
- **Vertical Scaling**
- **Auto-scaling**
- **Performance Optimization**

## System Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    Load[Increasing Load] --> Decision{Scale Type}
    Decision -->|More Power| Vertical[Vertical Scaling<br/>Bigger Servers]
    Decision -->|More Servers| Horizontal[Horizontal Scaling<br/>More Servers]
    Horizontal --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> Server1[Server 1]
    LB --> Server2[Server 2]
    LB --> ServerN[Server N]
```

## Real-World Example
WhatsApp handles 100 billion messages per day using horizontal scaling with minimal servers through efficient architecture design

## Discussion Questions
1. How do you decide between horizontal and vertical scaling for different components?
2. What metrics should trigger auto-scaling decisions in cloud environments?
