# Day 14: Distributed File Storage and Object Storage

## Overview
Distributed file storage systems provide scalable, durable storage for large amounts of unstructured data across multiple servers.

## Key Concepts
- **Object Storage**
- **Replication**
- **Erasure Coding**
- **Metadata Management**

## System Diagram

    Gateway --> Meta[Metadata Service]
    Gateway --> Node1[Storage Node 1]
    Gateway --> Node2[Storage Node 2]
    Gateway --> Node3[Storage Node 3]
```

## Real-World Example
Amazon S3 stores trillions of objects and handles millions of requests per second using distributed object storage architecture

## Discussion Questions
1. How do you ensure data durability in a distributed storage system?
2. What are the trade-offs between object storage and traditional file systems?
